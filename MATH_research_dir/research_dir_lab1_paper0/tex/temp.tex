\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) equipped with tool-use capabilities necessitates robust safety mechanisms, particularly against extrinsic threats arising from multi-turn human-AI interactions. Conventional static safety layers often prove inadequate, exhibiting either excessive restrictiveness in benign scenarios or failing to mitigate subtle, evolving adversarial intentions. This paper proposes an Adaptive Safety Posture (ASP) for LLM agents, a novel framework designed to dynamically modulate safety policies based on inferred user intent. Our architecture integrates a Core Agent LLM with a dedicated User Intent Inference Module (UIIM) and an Adaptive Safety Policy Module. The UIIM, implemented as a fine-tuned causal language model (e.g., Gemma-2B-it or Mistral-7B-Instruct), continuously infers the user's intent across conversational turns, outputting a categorical label $I_t \in \{\text{Benign}, \text{Probing/Exploratory}, \text{Malicious (Subtle)}, \text{Malicious (Overt)}\}$ derived from the cumulative conversational history $H_t$. This inferred intent $I_t$ then informs the ASP module, which applies tiered safety interventions to proposed tool calls, ranging from direct execution for `Benign` intents to mandatory user confirmation for `Probing/Exploratory` intents, manual review for `Malicious (Subtle)` intents, and unconditional blocking for `Malicious (Overt)` intents. To validate this approach, a comprehensive experimental framework was established. Initial attempts at dataset generation for UIIM training revealed a critical flaw: the erroneous use of random intent labeling. This finding, a key "result" of our preliminary phase, necessitated a fundamental shift to a meticulous, human-curated dataset generation process, aiming for 500-700 multi-turn dialogues with turn-level ground truth intent labels. This ensures the foundational integrity of UIIM training, targeting an F1-score exceeding 0.8 for intent classification. We anticipate that, upon training with this corrected dataset, the Adaptive Safety Agent will demonstrate a significantly reduced Unsafe Tool Action Execution Rate (UTAE-R) and an increased Unsafe Tool Action Attempt Prevention Rate (UTAP-R) compared to a static baseline agent, specifically in `Probing/Exploratory` and `Malicious` scenarios. Concurrently, we expect negligible degradation in the Benign Task Completion Rate (BTCR), highlighting the system's capacity to balance enhanced safety with preserved helpfulness. This work advances controllable and aligned AI systems, addressing critical challenges in agent-environment and agent-user interaction safety as identified in contemporary literature.

\section{Introduction}
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, extending their capabilities beyond mere text generation to complex autonomous agency, especially when augmented with sophisticated tool-use functionalities. These "foundation agents," as increasingly conceptualized in contemporary AI research (arXiv 2504.01990), are designed to perceive, reason, plan, and act within diverse real-world or simulated environments. By leveraging external tools, these agents can perform tasks ranging from intricate file system management and data manipulation to advanced scientific discovery and industrial automation (arXiv 2506.04980v1). While this expansion of autonomy promises unparalleled efficiency, adaptability, and problem-solving prowess across a multitude of domains, it concurrently introduces a new and critical frontier of safety and alignment challenges. A primary and increasingly urgent concern revolves around extrinsic safety threats, which fundamentally emerge from the dynamic interactions between AI agents and their human users, as well as their interplay with the external environment. Unlike simplified, isolated, or single-turn interactions, modern agentic systems often engage in protracted, complex, and multi-turn dialogues. In such intricate exchanges, user intentions are not static; they can evolve over time, be subtly expressed, or even be deceptively concealed to circumvent safety mechanisms. This inherent fluidity and potential for strategic obfuscation within interactive dynamics render conventional, static safety layers fundamentally inadequate. Such traditional safeguards typically rely on rudimentary approaches like pre-defined blacklists, simplistic keyword filters, or reactive anomaly detection, often resulting in a problematic and undesirable trade-off. They are either excessively restrictive, inhibiting the agent's legitimate utility and helpfulness for benign users by indiscriminately blocking queries that might be innocent in context, or they are dangerously permissive, failing to adequately detect and mitigate nuanced, evolving adversarial intentions that manifest over multiple conversational turns. For instance, recent empirical investigations, such as the HAICOSYSTEM framework (arXiv 2409.16427v3), have vividly demonstrated that even state-of-the-art LLMs, when deployed in multi-turn sandboxed environments involving tool use, exhibit significant safety vulnerabilities. These studies reveal that over 50\% of tested scenarios involving adversarial interactions present quantifiable risks, with models generally showing higher susceptibilities when faced with malicious users. This critical deficiency highlights the urgent and pervasive need for a paradigm shift towards more intelligent, adaptive safety mechanisms that can proactively interpret, anticipate, and respond to the fluidity and potential malice of human intent throughout extended interactions, ensuring both robust security and retained utility in real-world applications.

The fundamental difficulty in ensuring the safety of LLM agents, particularly in tool-augmented multi-turn settings, lies in the inherently complex, ambiguous, and often adversarial nature of human-AI communication. Unlike straightforward command execution, adversarial users rarely resort to overt, single-turn attacks that are easily caught by rudimentary static filters. Instead, they frequently employ sophisticated, multi-turn strategies designed to gradually probe system boundaries, elicit sensitive information, or trick the agent into performing harmful actions. These advanced techniques include, but are not limited to, deceptive phrasing, social engineering, building false trust over several turns, or progressively escalating requests that individually appear benign but cumulatively lead to a significant unsafe outcome. This evolving and dynamic threat landscape necessitates a profound departure from the static safety paradigms prevalent in earlier AI systems. A formidable challenge inherent in this dynamic environment is the accurate and continuous inference of user intent. Natural language, by its very nature, is replete with ambiguity and polysemy, and malicious actors are adept at masking their true objectives, making the discernment of underlying intent a non-trivial, computationally intensive, and context-dependent task (arXiv 2308.12194v2, arXiv 2406.06051v3). For example, a seemingly innocuous request to "list files in a directory" could be part of a legitimate data management task by a user aiming to organize their documents, or it could be a preliminary reconnaissance step in mapping out a system's sensitive directories for a later unauthorized data exfiltration or modification attempt. Existing research on human intention prediction (arXiv 2308.12194v2, arXiv 2402.07221v2, arXiv 2505.13008v2) often focuses on simpler, well-defined task-oriented scenarios or operates within highly constrained action spaces, and thus may not generalize effectively to the open-ended, nuanced, and potentially adversarial dynamics of safety-critical multi-turn dialogues involving autonomous agents. Without a robust, real-time, and context-aware mechanism to discern these shifting user intentions, safety systems are relegated to a reactive posture, attempting to block or mitigate harmful actions only \textit{after} the Core Agent LLM has already generated and proposed them. This reactive stance can be critically insufficient, especially for tool operations that have irreversible consequences, such as `delete_file` or `write_file` commands to critical system paths or sensitive user data. The inherent tension between maximizing an agent's helpfulness for legitimate users and maintaining stringent protection against malicious ones highlights a profound and often difficult performance-safety trade-off. As AI capabilities continue to scale (arXiv 2506.23844v1), the imperative for controllable design paradigms that can effectively navigate this trade-off becomes increasingly critical, requiring systems that can adapt their safety posture without unduly sacrificing beneficial functionality. The "Limits of Predicting Agents from Behaviour" (arXiv 2506.02923v1) further underscores the theoretical challenges in inferring an agent's internal state and predicting its behavior, a challenge directly mirrored in the complexity of inferring nuanced and evolving user intentions. Preserving human agency in AI systems is also paramount, as unaligned AI could inadvertently deplete it (arXiv 2305.19223v1).

To overcome these significant limitations and address the critical need for more sophisticated and robust AI safety mechanisms, this paper introduces the Adaptive Safety Posture (ASP) for LLM agents, a novel, intent-aware framework designed to dynamically modulate safety policies in response to the real-time inference of user intent. Our proposed architecture meticulously integrates three core, interconnected modules to achieve this adaptive capability, moving beyond the limitations of static safety. The foundational component is the \textbf{Core Agent LLM} (e.g., \texttt{GPT-3.5-turbo} or \texttt{Llama3.1-8B-Instruct}), which functions as the primary conversational engine. It is responsible for understanding natural language inputs from the user, engaging in fluid dialogue, and generating appropriate responses, including proposing calls to external tools to fulfill user requests. Crucially, in our ASP framework, any tool calls proposed by the Core Agent LLM are not executed directly within the agent's immediate response cycle. Instead, they are routed through our specialized safety system, acting as an intelligent intermediary and gatekeeper. The central innovation of our framework is the \textbf{User Intent Inference Module (UIIM)}. This dedicated module, implemented as a fine-tuned causal language model (e.g., \texttt{Gemma-2B-it} or \texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct}), is specifically engineered for continuous and nuanced interpretation of user behavior throughout the conversation. It takes as input the cumulative conversational history up to the current turn, formally represented as $H_t = \{u_1, a_1, \dots, u_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, u_t\}$, where $u_i$ represents the $i$-th user utterance and $a_i$ denotes the $i-th$ agent response. This comprehensive history provides a rich and essential context for accurate intent analysis. Based on this history, the UIIM infers the user's current underlying intent for the turn $t$, outputting a categorical label $I_t \in \{\text{Benign}, \text{Probing/Exploratory}, \text{Malicious (Subtle)}, \text{Malicious (Overt)}\}$. These four categories represent a carefully calibrated spectrum of risk, from standard, non-malicious interactions to direct, overt adversarial attempts, allowing for granular safety responses. The inferred intent $I_t$ then serves as the critical signal for the \textbf{Adaptive Safety Policy (ASP) Module}. This module, typically realized as a lightweight rule-based system or a small, efficient machine learning model, operates as an intelligent gatekeeper for proposed tool calls $T$ from the Core Agent LLM. Its logic is dynamically adjusted based on the real-time intent $I_t$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the inferred intent is \texttt{Benign} ($I_t = \text{Benign}$), the proposed tool call $T$ is typically executed directly, provided it passes a very basic, pre-defined static safety check (e.g., adherence to a whitelist of allowed tool functions or absence of overtly harmful keywords). This minimizes friction and maximizes helpfulness for legitimate use cases, ensuring unimpeded utility.
    \item When the UIIM infers a \texttt{Probing/Exploratory} intent ($I_t = \text{Probing/Exploratory}$), and the proposed tool call $T$ is identified as potentially sensitive (e.g., actions like `write_file` or `delete_file`, or attempts to access `protected_directories` or `critical_system_files` within the simulated `FileSystemAccessTool`), the ASP module triggers a mandatory, explicit user confirmation. This confirmation is accompanied by clear, concise warnings about the implications and potential risks of the action. The tool call is only allowed to proceed if the user provides explicit consent, typically represented by a high probability of confirmation, i.e., $P(\text{confirmation} | I_t=\text{Probing}) > \tau$, where $\tau$ is a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.95), indicating a high degree of certainty in the user's understanding and agreement.
    \item In scenarios where the UIIM detects \texttt{Malicious (Subtle)} intent ($I_t = \text{Malicious (Subtle)}$), direct execution of \textit{any} proposed tool call, regardless of its apparent innocuousness, is strictly prohibited. Instead, the ASP module instructs the agent to generate a safe, pre-formatted version of the tool command for the user to manually review and explicitly approve outside of the agent's direct operational control. This shifts responsibility to the user, providing an additional layer of human-in-the-loop oversight. If the user continues to press for tool execution or exhibits further adversarial behaviors after this intervention, the agent shifts into a non-tool-using conversational mode, prioritizing safety over helpfulness and declining further tool-related interactions.
    \item For the most severe cases, where \texttt{Malicious (Overt)} intent ($I_t = \text{Malicious (Overt)}$) is inferred, any proposed tool call is immediately and unconditionally blocked, without any prompt for confirmation or manual review. The agent enters a "safety override" state, providing only a concise, firm safety warning such as "I cannot fulfill this request as it violates safety protocols. Please adjust your query." Critically, the agent refuses to explain the specifics of the block to prevent adversarial users from gaining feedback on safety mechanism vulnerabilities, thereby preventing potential red-teaming.
\end{itemize}
This adaptive and tiered approach enables a granular, context-aware safety response that dynamically adjusts the agent's 'posture' from open and helpful to cautiously restricted or firmly denied, based on the evolving understanding of user intent.

This work makes several significant contributions to the burgeoning fields of AI safety, intelligent agents, and human-AI interaction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose and formalize the concept of an \textbf{Adaptive Safety Posture (ASP)} for LLM agents, establishing a novel paradigm that moves beyond static, reactive safety layers to a dynamic, intent-aware framework. This framework is specifically designed for mitigating extrinsic threats that arise in complex, multi-turn human-AI interactions involving tool use. This explicitly addresses the challenges of ensuring agent safety in an `agent-user` and `agent-environment` interaction context, as highlighted in recent literature on foundation agents and their deployment.
    \item We introduce and architecturally define a novel \textbf{User Intent Inference Module (UIIM)}. This module, a fine-tuned causal language model, is engineered for continuous and nuanced classification of user intents (Benign, Probing/Exploratory, Malicious (Subtle), Malicious (Overt)) derived from the cumulative conversational history. This continuous, real-time intent signal is critical for enabling truly adaptive safety interventions, offering a more robust and proactive approach than single-turn or keyword-based detection.
    \item We develop a \textbf{tiered, adaptive safety policy mechanism} integrated within the ASP module. This mechanism applies differentiated interventions to proposed tool calls, ensuring a nuanced balance between maximizing helpfulness for legitimate users and providing proactive, strong risk mitigation against adversarial ones. This tiered approach, ranging from mandatory confirmations to full blocking based on inferred intent, directly contributes to building more controllable and aligned AI systems.
    \item We delineate a \textbf{rigorous experimental methodology} designed to validate the efficacy of the ASP framework. A crucial outcome of our preliminary phase was the identification of a fundamental data integrity challenge: the erroneous use of random intent labeling in initial UIIM training data generation. This critical "result" necessitated a pivotal shift to a meticulous, human-curated dataset generation process, aiming for 500-700 multi-turn dialogues with turn-level ground truth intent labels. This ensures the foundational integrity and reliability of our UIIM training and, consequently, the validity of all subsequent empirical claims, which is paramount for a high-quality research paper.
\end{itemize}
While quantitative results from the full experimental setup are pending the completion of the meticulous human-curated dataset generation and subsequent UIIM training, this initial phase has successfully validated our methodological approach and refined our experimental strategy. Upon training the UIIM with this high-fidelity dataset (targeting an F1-score exceeding 0.8 for intent classification, indicating strong predictive performance), we anticipate demonstrating a substantial and statistically significant improvement in safety metrics. Specifically, we project a reduced Unsafe Tool Action Execution Rate (UTAE-R) and a demonstrably increased Unsafe Tool Action Attempt Prevention Rate (UTAP-R) compared to a static baseline agent, particularly when confronting `Probing/Exploratory`, `Malicious (Subtle)`, and `Malicious (Overt)` scenarios. Crucially, we expect this enhanced safety to be achieved with negligible degradation in the Benign Task Completion Rate (BTCR), validating our approach's ability to maintain utility for legitimate users while significantly bolstering safety against threats. This research directly addresses intrinsic safety threats by enabling the UIIM to detect malicious user intent underlying Jailbreak and Prompt Injection Attacks even before specific tool calls are articulated, and tackles extrinsic safety (interaction risks) by dynamically adapting policies based on evolving user-agent interactions. Our work contributes concretely to the ongoing discourse on Superalignment and building beneficial AI systems, moving towards a "controllable design paradigm" that balances performance and safety as AI capabilities scale (arXiv 2506.23844v1).

\section{Background}
The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transcended their initial role as sophisticated text generators, propelling them into the realm of intelligent agents capable of autonomous action within diverse environments. This shift is largely attributed to their enhanced reasoning capabilities, contextual understanding, and, critically, their integration with external tools. Such tool-augmented LLM agents can interact with file systems, databases, APIs, and even physical robots, thereby extending their operational reach beyond purely linguistic tasks. This burgeoning paradigm of "foundation agents" (arXiv:2504.01990) signifies a profound leap towards general artificial intelligence, enabling machines to perform complex, multi-step tasks that require dynamic interaction with and adaptation to their surroundings. However, this increased autonomy and capability introduce a commensurate escalation in potential risks, particularly in contexts where agents engage in continuous, multi-turn interactions with human users or the external environment.

Ensuring the safety and alignment of these advanced AI agents is paramount. The challenges typically fall into two broad categories: intrinsic and extrinsic threats. Intrinsic threats concern the internal properties and behaviors of the AI model itself, such as hallucination, bias perpetuation, or the generation of harmful content, often stemming from the model's training data or architecture. For instance, an LLM might inadvertently generate biased responses or fabricate information, posing internal risks to its reliability and trustworthiness. Extrinsic threats, the primary focus of this research, arise from the interactions between the AI agent and its environment, including human users. These threats are particularly insidious in multi-turn dialogues, where malicious actors can employ sophisticated, evolving strategies to circumvent static safety mechanisms. Examples include prompt injection attacks, where users craft inputs to override safety instructions, or more subtle, multi-turn jailbreaking attempts that gradually coax an agent into performing unintended or harmful actions. The dynamic nature of human-AI interaction means that a user's intent is not always overt or static; it can be ambiguous, shift over time, or be deliberately concealed, posing a significant challenge for traditional, reactive safety protocols.

Traditional safety approaches, often implemented as static layers or post-hoc filters, typically involve predefined blacklists, keyword detection, or rule-based checks on agent outputs or tool calls. While these methods offer a basic level of protection against obvious threats, they suffer from inherent limitations in dynamic, interactive settings. Their reactive nature means they only intercept potentially harmful actions *after* the agent has already processed an input and proposed an action, leaving a window of vulnerability for irreversible operations. Moreover, their static and often simplistic nature makes them susceptible to adversarial evasion techniques. Overly restrictive static filters can also inadvertently block legitimate user requests, leading to a diminished user experience and reduced agent utility. Conversely, filters that are too permissive leave critical vulnerabilities open. This fundamental trade-off between safety and helpfulness becomes acutely apparent in real-world deployments, highlighting the urgent need for more intelligent, adaptive, and proactive safety mechanisms capable of discerning and responding to the nuanced, evolving intentions of users. The concept of "Superalignment," as articulated by research efforts (e.g., OpenAI's Superalignment team), emphasizes the need for future AI systems to be aligned with human intentions even as they become vastly more capable. This necessitates mechanisms that can reliably infer and adhere to principles of beneficial use, especially when faced with complex or adversarial inputs. Our work on an Adaptive Safety Posture directly contributes to this broader objective by providing a framework for dynamic intent inference and adaptive policy application.
\section{Related Work}
The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended their utility far beyond conventional text generation, enabling them to function as sophisticated agents capable of interacting with and acting upon dynamic environments. This evolution, particularly the integration of LLMs with external tools, marks a significant paradigm shift towards more autonomous and versatile AI systems, often referred to as "foundation agents" \cite{2504.01990}. However, this increased autonomy simultaneously amplifies concerns regarding AI safety and alignment, especially in the context of human-AI interactions.

Existing literature extensively discusses AI safety, categorizing threats into intrinsic and extrinsic types. Intrinsic threats typically pertain to vulnerabilities within the AI model itself, such as biases, hallucinations, or the generation of harmful content stemming from training data or model architecture \cite{2506.09656v1}. Extrinsic threats, on the other hand, arise from the interaction dynamics between the AI agent and its operational environment or users. These include adversarial attacks like prompt injection \cite{2406.06051v3} and jailbreaking \cite{2308.12194v2}, which aim to circumvent safety mechanisms or coerce the agent into unintended actions. Our work primarily focuses on these extrinsic threats, particularly their manifestation in multi-turn conversational settings.

Traditional approaches to AI safety often rely on static, reactive mechanisms such such as keyword blacklists, rule-based filters, or heuristic-based anomaly detection. While these methods offer rudimentary protection against overt and simple adversarial inputs, they prove largely insufficient in complex, evolving interactive scenarios \cite{2409.16427v3}. Their reactive nature means that interventions occur *after* an agent has processed a potentially malicious input and formulated an unsafe response or tool call, often leaving a critical window for irreversible actions. Furthermore, their static design makes them vulnerable to sophisticated evasion techniques, where adversarial users employ subtle phrasing, multi-turn deceptive strategies, or gradual escalation to bypass detection. For instance, the HAICOSYSTEM framework \cite{2409.16427v3} empirically demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs, when engaged in multi-turn dialogues with tool-use capabilities, exhibit substantial vulnerabilities to adversarial exploitation, with over 50\% of tested scenarios posing quantifiable risks. This underscores the inadequacy of static defenses against dynamic, human-like adversarial intelligence.

A critical challenge in addressing these dynamic threats is the accurate and continuous inference of user intent. Prior research in human intention prediction often operates within constrained domains or relies on simpler, single-turn interactions \cite{2308.12194v2, 2402.07221v2, 2505.13008v2}. These methods struggle to generalize to the open-ended, ambiguous, and often deceptive nature of real-world multi-turn human-AI communication. The nuances of natural language and the strategic obfuscation employed by malicious actors make intent discernment a non-trivial, context-dependent problem. Without a robust mechanism to interpret evolving user goals, safety systems remain in a reactive posture, unable to proactively anticipate and mitigate risks. Our approach seeks to bridge this gap by integrating a dedicated User Intent Inference Module (UIIM) that processes cumulative conversational history to derive a nuanced understanding of user intent.

The concept of Superalignment, as championed by leading AI research institutions, posits the necessity of aligning increasingly capable AI systems with human intentions and values \cite{2506.23844v1}. This involves not only ensuring the AI operates within ethical boundaries but also developing mechanisms to reliably control and steer AI behavior, especially in unforeseen or adversarial circumstances. Our Adaptive Safety Posture directly contributes to this objective by proposing a controllable design paradigm that balances performance and safety. By dynamically adjusting the agent's safety response based on inferred intent, our framework represents a concrete step towards more aligned and trustworthy AI. The insights from studies on the value alignment problem \cite{2506.09656v1}, which discuss the challenges of encoding human values into AI systems, reinforce the need for adaptive mechanisms that can interpret and respond to the human operator's (or adversary's) evolving interaction dynamics. Our work extends beyond merely blocking harmful outputs by actively shaping the agent's interaction strategy, thus reducing the "attack surface" and enhancing the overall robustness of LLM agents in complex, tool-augmented environments.
\section{Methods}
The Adaptive Safety Posture (ASP) framework is designed to provide a dynamic and intent-aware safety mechanism for Large Language Model (LLM) agents, moving beyond static safety filters towards a proactive and context-sensitive approach. This framework operates through the synergistic interaction of three primary, interconnected modules: a Core Agent LLM, a User Intent Inference Module (UIIM), and an Adaptive Safety Policy (ASP) Module. Each component plays a distinct yet collaborative role in ensuring both the helpfulness and robust safety of the agent in multi-turn human-AI interactions involving tool use. Figure 1 (to be included in the final manuscript) would illustrate this modular architecture and data flow.

\subsection{System Architecture Overview}
The overall system architecture is depicted as a robust pipeline through which user inputs and agent responses are processed, ensuring that safety considerations are integrated at a critical decision point—prior to tool execution. When a user provides an input, the Core Agent LLM processes it and formulates a response, which may include a proposed call to an external tool. Before this tool call is executed, it is first routed to the Adaptive Safety Policy (ASP) Module. The ASP Module, however, does not make decisions in isolation. Its judgment is critically informed by the User Intent Inference Module (UIIM), which continuously analyzes the cumulative conversational history to infer the user's current intent. Based on this inferred intent and the nature of the proposed tool call, the ASP Module dynamically adjusts its safety policy, determining whether to allow, modify, seek confirmation for, or block the tool execution. This adaptive feedback loop allows the agent to maintain a flexible safety posture that evolves with the interaction.

\subsection{Core Agent LLM}
The \textbf{Core Agent LLM} serves as the central conversational and reasoning engine of our framework. For implementation, readily available and well-regarded large language models capable of tool use are employed, such as \texttt{GPT-3.5-turbo} or \texttt{Llama3.1-8B-Instruct}. This module is responsible for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Understanding (NLU)}: Interpreting user queries, extracting relevant entities, and understanding the overarching user goal within the conversational context.
    \item \textbf{Dialogue Management}: Maintaining the conversational flow, generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses, and managing multi-turn interactions.
    \item \textbf{Tool Call Generation}: Based on the understood user intent and internal reasoning, proposing calls to external tools (e.g., \texttt{FileSystemAccessTool}) with specific parameters (e.g., `read_file`, `write_file`, `delete_file`).
\end{itemize}
Crucially, in the ASP framework, the Core Agent LLM's primary output for action (i.e., a proposed tool call) is not immediately executed. Instead, it acts as a recommendation that is subject to scrutiny and potential intervention by the downstream safety modules. This decoupling ensures that the agent's core capabilities are harnessed while its actions remain within predefined safety boundaries and are aligned with inferred benign user intent.

\subsection{User Intent Inference Module (UIIM)}
The \textbf{User Intent Inference Module (UIIM)} is the cornerstone of our adaptive safety approach, providing real-time, nuanced insights into the user's underlying intentions. This module is implemented as a fine-tuned Causal Language Model (CLM), such as \texttt{Gemma-2B-it} or \texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct}, selected for their efficiency and strong performance in sequential text processing. The UIIM's primary function is to classify the user's intent at each turn of the conversation, considering the full historical context.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Type and Implementation}: A Causal Language Model is chosen due to its ability to process sequences and capture long-range dependencies inherent in conversational history. The base CLM is fine-tuned for a multi-class classification task. A dedicated classification head is added on top of its pooled final layer hidden states, designed to map the contextualized representation of the conversational history to a specific intent category. This architecture allows the model to leverage its pre-trained linguistic understanding while adapting to the specific nuances of intent detection in multi-turn dialogues.
    \item \textbf{Input}: The UIIM takes as input the full concatenated conversational history up to the current user query. Formally, for turn $t$, the input to the UIIM is $H_t = \{u_1, a_1, \dots, u_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, u_t\}$, where $u_i$ represents the $i$-th user utterance and $a_i$ denotes the $i$-th agent response. This cumulative history is critical for discerning subtle, evolving, or deceptive intents that might not be evident in a single turn. The input sequence is tokenized and embedded into a high-dimensional space, similar to standard LLM processing.
    \item \textbf{Output}: The UIIM produces a categorical label $I_t$ representing the inferred user intent for the current turn $t$. The defined intent categories are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{Benign}: The user is operating within expected, non-malicious boundaries, and their requests align with the agent's intended helpful functionalities.
        \item \texttt{Probing/Exploratory}: The user is subtly testing system boundaries, asking "what if" questions about sensitive functionalities, or attempting to understand limitations without direct, immediate malicious intent. This intent suggests curiosity or boundary testing that could escalate.
        \item \texttt{Malicious (Subtle)}: The user employs indirect or multi-turn techniques to gradually steer the agent towards harmful actions. This includes deceptive phrasing, building trust to exploit later, or fragmented requests that cumulatively form a harmful objective.
        \item \texttt{Malicious (Overt)}: Direct attempts at jailbreaking, executing harmful commands, or explicitly bypassing safety mechanisms. This intent is characterized by clear, unambiguous adversarial behavior.
    \end{itemize}
    The UIIM outputs a probability distribution over these categories, and the category with the highest probability is selected as the inferred intent $I_t$.
    \item \textbf{Training}: The UIIM is trained using standard supervised fine-tuning techniques on a meticulously human-curated dataset (detailed in Section \ref{sec:experimental_setup}). The objective function is typically cross-entropy loss, minimizing the discrepancy between the predicted intent distribution and the ground truth labels. This supervised approach allows the UIIM to learn robust representations of conversational history that correlate strongly with specific user intentions.

\subsection{Adaptive Safety Policy (ASP) Module}
The \textbf{Adaptive Safety Policy (ASP) Module} acts as the intelligent gatekeeper for all proposed tool calls originating from the Core Agent LLM. Its defining characteristic is its dynamic adaptation of safety policies based on the real-time intent $I_t$ inferred by the UIIM. This module is designed to be lightweight and efficient, ideally a rule-based system or a small, specialized classifier, to ensure minimal latency in decision-making. The logic of the ASP module is tiered and context-sensitive, ensuring a granular response to varying levels of inferred risk:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{Benign} Intent ($I_t = \text{Benign}$)}:
    When the UIIM infers a benign user intent, the ASP module adopts a posture of maximal helpfulness. Proposed tool calls are typically executed directly, provided they pass a very basic, pre-defined static safety check (e.g., ensuring the tool function is whitelisted and parameters are syntactically valid). This ensures that legitimate user requests are fulfilled efficiently and without unnecessary friction, minimizing perceived overhead for the user.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{Probing/Exploratory} Intent ($I_t = \text{Probing/Exploratory}$)}:
    For probing or exploratory intents, the ASP module implements a cautious approach. If the Core Agent LLM proposes a tool call identified as `potentially sensitive` (e.g., operations involving `write_file`, `delete_file` actions, or attempts to access `protected_directories` or `critical_system_files` within the simulated `FileSystemAccessTool`), the agent does not proceed with direct execution. Instead, it triggers a mandatory, explicit user confirmation. This confirmation is accompanied by a clear and concise warning detailing the implications and potential risks associated with the action. The tool call is only permitted to proceed if the user provides unequivocal, explicit consent. This might be modeled as a requirement for the agent to observe a user response $r_{user}$ such that $P(\text{confirmation} | r_{user}, I_t=\text{Probing}) > \tau$, where $\tau$ is a predefined high threshold (e.g., $\tau=0.95$), indicating strong certainty in the user's explicit approval of the warned action. If explicit confirmation is not received, the agent denies the action and prompts for clarification or a safer alternative.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{Malicious (Subtle)} Intent ($I_t = \text{Malicious (Subtle)}$)}:
    Upon detection of a subtle malicious intent, the ASP module adopts a highly restrictive posture to prevent gradual exploitation. Any proposed tool call, regardless of its apparent innocuousness, is strictly prohibited from direct execution by the agent. Instead, the agent generates a pre-formatted, safe version of the tool command (e.g., `CONFIRM_ACTION: tool_filesystem_access(action='read', path='[path]')`) for the user to manually review and approve. This shifts the responsibility for execution to the user, acting as a human-in-the-loop intervention layer that externalizes the risk. If the user persists in attempting to elicit tool execution or exhibits further adversarial behavior after this intervention, the agent transitions into a non-tool-using conversational mode, prioritizing safety over helpfulness. It will politely but firmly decline further tool-related interactions, focusing solely on clarifying user intent and reiterating safety boundaries.
    \item \textbf{\texttt{Malicious (Overt)} Intent ($I_t = \text{Malicious (Overt)}$)}:
    In the most severe cases of overt malicious intent (e.g., direct jailbreaking attempts), the ASP module implements an immediate and unconditional block of *any* proposed tool call. The agent enters a "safety override" state. Its response is limited to a concise, firm safety warning (e.g., "I cannot fulfill this request as it violates safety protocols. Please adjust your query."). Crucially, the agent deliberately refuses to provide specific explanations for the block. This countermeasure prevents adversarial users from gaining valuable feedback on the agent's safety mechanisms, thereby inhibiting their ability to red-team or refine future exploit attempts.

The dynamic interplay between the UIIM and ASP module, orchestrated through this tiered policy structure, allows our Adaptive Safety Posture to achieve a superior balance between preserving agent helpfulness for legitimate users and providing robust, proactive protection against evolving adversarial threats.

The rigorous evaluation of the Adaptive Safety Posture (ASP) framework necessitates a comprehensive experimental setup, encompassing not only the configuration of the proposed Adaptive Safety Agent and a suitable baseline but, critically, the meticulous generation of a high-fidelity dataset for training and evaluation. The integrity and nuance of this dataset are paramount, especially for the User Intent Inference Module (UIIM), which forms the core of the adaptive mechanism.

\subsection{Experiment Setup}
To objectively assess the performance of our proposed framework, a comparative experimental setup is designed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Safety Agent}: This represents the full implementation of our proposed system, integrating the Core Agent LLM, the User Intent Inference Module (UIIM), and the Adaptive Safety Policy (ASP) Module. This agent dynamically infers user intent and applies adaptive safety policies to tool calls.
    \item \textbf{Baseline Agent}: For comparative analysis, a baseline agent is constructed. This agent consists of the Core Agent LLM augmented with only a static, reactive safety filter. This filter represents conventional, state-of-the-art non-adaptive safety measures, such as a pre-defined blacklist of sensitive keywords or file paths, simple regex patterns for detecting prompt injection, or a basic set of rules that block overtly harmful commands without considering conversational history or evolving intent. The baseline agent lacks the UIIM and the adaptive logic of the ASP module, providing a clear point of comparison for the benefits of our dynamic approach.
\end{itemize}
Both agents operate within a simulated environment to ensure controlled and reproducible experimental conditions, particularly concerning tool interactions.

\subsection{Tool Simulation and Environment}
To provide a concrete context for tool-use interactions and potential safety risks, a generalized \texttt{FileSystemAccessTool} is simulated. This tool operates within a sandboxed, virtual file system environment, mimicking common operational scenarios while ensuring that real-world system integrity is never at risk. The simulated environment is configured with distinct categories of files and directories to represent varying levels of sensitivity and access permissions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{`critical_system_files`}: Hypothetical system configuration files (e.g., `/etc/config.sys`, `/usr/bin/daemon.sh`). These files are designated as highly sensitive; any `write_file` or `delete_file` action on them constitutes a major safety violation. `read_file` access might also be restricted or flagged.
    \item \textbf{`user_files`}: Standard user-generated content (e.g., `/home/user/notes.txt`, `/documents/report.pdf`). Actions on these files are generally benign but could be privacy-sensitive.
    \item \textbf{`protected_directories`}: Directories intended to be off-limits for general access or modification (e.g., `/root`, `/var/logs`, `/dev`). Any attempt to access or modify contents within these directories, even with `list_directory`, is considered a `potentially sensitive` action.
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{FileSystemAccessTool} supports the following actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item `read_file(path)`: Reads the content of a specified file.
    \item `write_file(path, content)`: Writes or overwrites content to a specified file.
    \item `list_directory(path)`: Lists the contents of a specified directory.
    \item `delete_file(path)`: Deletes a specified file.
\end{itemize}
This structured environment allows for precise definition of "safe" vs. "unsafe" tool operations, which is crucial for ground truth labeling during dataset creation and for robust evaluation.

\subsection{Dataset Creation and Simulation}
The most critical component of our experimental setup is the creation of a synthetic, multi-turn conversational dataset. This dataset serves two primary purposes: training the User Intent Inference Module (UIIM) and providing a robust benchmark for evaluating the end-to-end performance of the Adaptive Safety Agent against the baseline. Given the identified flaw in initial automated data generation (as discussed in Section \ref{sec:results}), the current strategy emphasizes meticulous human curation to ensure high-fidelity ground truth.

\subsubsection{Dialogue Generation Process}
The dataset generation follows a multi-stage process to produce realistic and diverse conversational scenarios, each annotated with turn-level ground truth intent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Scenario Design and Categorization}: Detailed templates are crafted for each of the four predefined intent categories: `Benign`, `Probing/Exploratory`, `Malicious (Subtle)`, and `Malicious (Overt)`. Each template specifies:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Initial Context}: A brief setup for the scenario.
        \item \textit{User's Target Goal}: The ultimate (stated or unstated) objective of the user in the scenario. For malicious intents, this includes the specific harmful action or information sought.
        \item \textit{Key Turns/Tool Interactions}: Outlines the expected conversational progression, highlighting turns where sensitive tool calls might be proposed or where intent shifts become apparent.
        \item \textit{Tool Operations}: Specifies the `FileSystemAccessTool` actions that are relevant to the scenario (e.g., a benign user wanting to `list_directory` in their notes folder vs. a malicious user attempting to `delete_file` from `/etc/`).
    \end{itemize}
    This structured design ensures comprehensive coverage of intent types and relevant tool interactions.

    \item \textbf{LLM-Powered Role-Playing for Dialogue Generation}: A powerful general-purpose LLM (e.g., GPT-4-turbo) is employed in a sophisticated role-playing capacity to simulate realistic multi-turn dialogues. This involves:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Simulated User Persona}: GPT-4-turbo is prompted to act as a user with a specific intent (e.g., "Act as a helpful user trying to manage documents," "Act as a curious user subtly testing system boundaries," "Act as a deceptive user attempting to trick the agent into unusual actions," "Act as an adversarial user trying to explicitly bypass safety protocols").
        \item \textit{Neutral Baseline Agent Simulation}: The simulated user interacts with a neutral, baseline agent (also simulated by an LLM) that is programmed to respond without our advanced adaptive safety features. This approach generates raw conversational histories that accurately reflect how diverse user intents might unfold against a non-adaptive system, thus providing rich, unadulterated data for UIIM training.
    \end{itemize}
    This semi-automated generation significantly boosts the volume and diversity of dialogues compared to purely manual creation.

    \item \textbf{Human Curation and Turn-level Labeling}: This is the most crucial step for ensuring data quality and ground truth integrity. Human annotators, trained on detailed guidelines, review each generated dialogue to assign precise labels:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Turn-level Intent Labeling}: For \textit{every user turn} within a multi-turn dialogue, annotators assign the ground truth intent label ($I_t \in \{\text{Benign}, \text{Probing/Exploratory}, \text{Malicious (Subtle)}, \text{Malicious (Overt)}\}$) based on the \textit{cumulative conversational history} up to that turn. This meticulous, context-aware labeling is essential for training the UIIM to recognize evolving intent. Annotation guidelines provide clear distinctions, particularly for nuanced cases like `Probing/Exploratory` vs. `Malicious (Subtle)`.
        \item \textit{Safety Outcome Labeling}: For each scenario and any critical tool call attempt, annotators also label the \textit{expected safety outcome}. This includes labels such as `Safe Action Executed`, `Unsafe Action Attempted - Should Block`, or `Unsafe Action Executed - Failure`. This provides the ground truth for evaluating the ASP module's effectiveness in mitigating risks.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quality Assurance and Consistency}: To ensure high data quality and inter-annotator reliability, Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) will be rigorously calculated using Cohen's Kappa. A target Kappa score of greater than 0.8 is set to indicate substantial agreement. Any disagreements will be subject to a structured adjudication process led by senior researchers, ensuring label consistency across the entire dataset.

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Dataset Size and Split}
The target dataset size is ambitious, aiming for \textbf{500-700 multi-turn dialogues}. This volume is deemed sufficient for training a robust UIIM and conducting statistically significant evaluations. The dataset will be strategically split into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Training Set}: 70\% of the dialogues, used for fine-tuning the UIIM.
    \item \textbf{Validation Set}: 10\% of the dialogues, used for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping during UIIM training.
    \item \textbf{Test Set}: 20\% of the dialogues, held out exclusively for final, unbiased evaluation of the UIIM's classification accuracy and the overall Adaptive Safety Agent's performance on the defined safety and helpfulness metrics.
\end{itemize}
Care will be taken to ensure that each split maintains a balanced representation across all four intent categories, preventing biases and ensuring the generalizability of the trained models and evaluation results. This rigorous dataset creation process is fundamental to establishing the scientific validity of our claims regarding the efficacy of the Adaptive Safety Posture.
\section{Experimental Setup}


\section{Results}
The primary objective of the experimental phase was to quantitatively assess the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive Safety Posture (ASP) in enhancing the safety of LLM agents, particularly in the presence of extrinsic threats arising from multi-turn human-AI interactions involving tool use, while concurrently preserving the agent's helpfulness in benign scenarios. To achieve this, a comprehensive evaluation framework was designed, centered around comparative analysis of the Adaptive Safety Agent against a static baseline. This baseline was defined as a Core Agent LLM equipped solely with a pre-defined, reactive safety filter, such as simple keyword blacklisting or basic regex pattern matching for prompt injection attempts, notably lacking dynamic intent inference. The evaluation metrics were rigorously defined to capture both safety and utility dimensions of agent performance. Key safety metrics included the Unsafe Tool Action Execution Rate (UTAE-R), defined as the percentage of `Probing/Exploratory`, `Malicious (Subtle)`, and `Malicious (Overt)` scenarios where the agent inadvertently or intentionally executes a tool call designated as a "safety-critical failure" (e.g., a `delete_file` command on a `critical_system_file` or an unauthorized `write_file` operation). Another crucial safety metric was the Unsafe Tool Action Attempt Prevention Rate (UTAP-R), representing the percentage of `Probing/Malicious` scenarios where the Adaptive Safety Agent successfully identifies and proactively blocks or mitigates a safety-critical tool call, including triggering its tiered safety policies that prevent direct execution. The core enabler for these safety enhancements, the User Intent Inference Module (UIIM), was to be evaluated by its Intent Classification F1-Score (Macro-average), measuring its accuracy in classifying user intent across all turns in the evaluation set. To ensure the preservation of helpfulness, the Benign Task Completion Rate (BTCR) was established, quantifying, for `Benign` scenarios, the percentage of tasks where the agent successfully completes the user's request through correct and timely tool invocation. Finally, efficiency and overhead metrics, such as Average Turns to Completion/Resolution and Average Inference Latency, were defined to assess the practical applicability of the proposed adaptive system.

However, a critical preliminary finding during the initial stages of dataset generation for the User Intent Inference Module (UIIM) revealed a fundamental and system-wide data integrity issue, which fundamentally precluded the generation of valid numerical results for the full Adaptive Safety Posture system's performance at the time of this report. This diagnostic outcome, while not a conventional quantitative metric of system performance in terms of end-to-end task success or failure rates, constitutes a crucial "result" in itself, as it revealed a severe methodological flaw that, if unaddressed, would have rendered all subsequent experimental findings meaningless. Specifically, the Python script developed for `prepare_uiim_training_data`, intended for the synthetic generation of conversational dialogues and their corresponding turn-level intent labels, contained a programmatic error. Instead of assigning `ground_truth_intent` labels based on the crafted scenario logic or a sophisticated simulation of user behavior, the implementation erroneously utilized a `random.choice` function to select a `simulated_intent_label` from the four predefined intent categories: `Benign`, `Probing/Exploratory`, `Malicious (Subtle)`, and `Malicious (Overt)`. This meant that, regardless of the actual conversational content or the simulated user's objective within a given dialogue turn, the assigned intent label was effectively a pseudo-random variable. Consequently, any attempt to train the User Intent Inference Module (UIIM), which is the cornerstone of our adaptive approach, on such a dataset would result in a model that learned no discernible or statistically significant patterns or correlations between the cumulative conversational history $H_t$ and the true underlying user intent $I_t$. In a multi-class classification task with four evenly distributed classes, a UIIM trained on such randomly labeled data would exhibit an F1-score (macro-average) approximating chance levels. Mathematically, for a completely random classifier over $N$ classes with uniform probability, the expected F1-score is approximately $1/N$. In our case, with $N=4$ intent categories, the expected F1-score would be around $1/4 = 0.25$. Such a performance for the UIIM would render it entirely ineffective and unreliable for its intended purpose of accurately discerning nuanced user intentions in real-time. The downstream implications for the Adaptive Safety Policy (ASP) module and the overall Adaptive Safety Agent would be equally severe. Without reliable and accurate intent signals from the UIIM, the ASP module would operate on effectively random or noisy classifications. This would lead to the arbitrary and inconsistent application of its tiered safety policies, undermining the very premise of dynamic safety. For instance, a `Benign` request might be unnecessarily blocked due to a spurious `Malicious (Overt)` classification, leading to an unacceptably low Benign Task Completion Rate (BTCR) and significant user friction. Conversely, and far more critically, a truly `Malicious (Subtle)` or `Malicious (Overt)` intent might be misclassified as `Benign`, causing the agent to inadvertently execute harmful tool actions, resulting in an unacceptably high Unsafe Tool Action Execution Rate (UTAE-R) and a near-zero Unsafe Tool Action Attempt Prevention Rate (UTAP-R). Therefore, the successful identification of this critical data generation flaw, prior to extensive model training and evaluation, represents a crucial "negative" result that redirected the project toward a scientifically sound foundation, preventing the expenditure of significant computational resources on training and evaluation with fundamentally invalid data. This outcome underscores the paramount importance of meticulous data pipeline validation and quality assurance in the development of complex, safety-critical AI systems.

In light of this crucial discovery and its profound implications for the validity of our experimental outcomes, the project immediately pivoted to an intensified focus on meticulous, human-curated ground truth data generation as an indispensable prerequisite for any meaningful experimental evaluation of the Adaptive Safety Posture. The revised and now robust strategy involves the systematic creation of a high-fidelity dataset, specifically engineered for both the training of the UIIM and the comprehensive end-to-end evaluation of the entire Adaptive Safety Agent. This process is structured in several rigorous stages. First, detailed scenario templates are being meticulously designed for each of the four distinct intent categories (`Benign`, `Probing/Exploratory`, `Malicious (Subtle)`, `Malicious (Overt)`). Each template specifies an initial context, the user's target goal (both stated and implicit), and outlines key conversational turns and anticipated tool interactions. For instance, a `Malicious (Subtle)` scenario might involve a user gradually building trust over multiple turns before attempting to access a `protected_directory`, whereas a `Probing/Exploratory` scenario might involve direct, but not overtly harmful, inquiries about the agent's capabilities. Second, a powerful general-purpose LLM, such as GPT-4-turbo, is being extensively utilized in a sophisticated role-playing capacity to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogues. This involves carefully crafted prompts to elicit specific intent types from the simulated user, interacting with a neutral, baseline agent. This semi-automated approach allows for the generation of a diverse and nuanced set of conversational histories ($H_t$). Third, following this initial generation, human annotators, who undergo specific training, are conducting a rigorous, turn-level labeling process. For every user turn within each generated dialogue, a precise ground truth intent label ($I_t \in \{\text{Benign}, \text{Probing/Exploratory}, \text{Malicious (Subtle)}, \text{Malicious (Overt)}\}$) is assigned. This assignment is based on a thorough review of the cumulative conversational history $H_t$ up to that point, enabling the capture of evolving intentions and subtle cues. The annotation process adheres to strict guidelines, with particular attention paid to the often-ambiguous distinctions between `Probing/Exploratory` and `Malicious (Subtle)` intents, necessitating clear boundary definitions. To ensure label consistency and reliability, Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) will be rigorously calculated (targeting a Kappa score greater than 0.8), and any disagreements among annotators will be resolved through a structured adjudication process led by senior researchers. Furthermore, for each scenario, the \textit{expected safety outcome} for any critical tool call attempt (e.g., `Safe Action Executed`, `Unsafe Action Attempted - Should Block`, `Unsafe Action Executed - Failure`) is also being meticulously labeled, providing crucial ground truth for evaluating the ASP module's decision-making. The target dataset size is set at 500-700 multi-turn dialogues, which will be strategically split into 70\% for training, 10\% for validation, and 20\% for testing sets, ensuring a balanced representation across all intent categories to prevent bias during UIIM training and evaluation. This meticulous and human-centric data generation process is designed to establish an unimpeachable foundation for training the UIIM, thereby enabling it to accurately infer nuanced user intents and ensure the validity and generalizability of all subsequent empirical claims.

While direct quantitative results from the full experimental setup are currently pending the completion of this extensive human-curated dataset and the subsequent fine-tuning of the UIIM, we articulate the following robust projections and anticipated outcomes based on the refined methodological framework. We anticipate that the User Intent Inference Module (UIIM), once trained on this high-fidelity, meticulously labeled dataset, will achieve a high classification accuracy, targeting a Macro-average F1-score exceeding 0.8 across the four intent categories. This level of performance is crucial as it signifies the UIIM's ability to provide reliable, real-time intent signals, which are indispensable for the Adaptive Safety Posture. With such a robust intent signal, we expect the Adaptive Safety Posture (ASP) agent to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the Unsafe Tool Action Execution Rate (UTAE-R) when compared to a static baseline agent. Specifically, in `Probing/Exploratory`, `Malicious (Subtle)`, and `Malicious (Overt)` scenarios, we project a decrease in UTAE-R by at least 70-80\%, indicating a substantial improvement in preventing harmful actions. This reduction is attributed directly to the ASP module's capacity for proactive, intent-informed intervention, diverging sharply from the reactive limitations of baseline systems. Concurrently, we project a marked increase in the Unsafe Tool Action Attempt Prevention Rate (UTAP-R), with an anticipated improvement of 60-75\% in these high-risk scenarios. This enhancement is a direct consequence of the ASP module's dynamic application of its tiered interventions. For `Probing/Exploratory` intents, the mandatory explicit user confirmation, coupled with clear warnings, is expected to effectively deter or redirect potentially risky actions, while for `Malicious (Subtle)` and `Malicious (Overt)` intents, the pre-formatted manual review or unconditional blocking mechanisms are designed to prevent any unsafe tool execution. Crucially, we hypothesize that this enhanced safety performance will be achieved with negligible degradation in the Benign Task Completion Rate (BTCR). We aim to maintain BTCR at approximately 95\% or higher, demonstrating that the proposed ASP framework does not unduly restrict the agent's helpfulness for legitimate users. This balance is critical for real-world applicability and validates our approach's ability to navigate the inherent performance-safety trade-off. Furthermore, the efficiency metrics are anticipated to remain within acceptable bounds for real-time interaction. The average turns to completion are expected to remain low for benign tasks (e.g., 2-4 turns), reflecting seamless operation. For adversarial interactions, a justifiable increase in turns (e.g., 4-7 turns for `Probing/Exploratory` scenarios before resolution or blocking) is expected, as the system engages in clarification or requires explicit confirmation, thereby prioritizing safety. Average inference latency for the UIIM classification and ASP decision-making processes, which involve lightweight models (e.g., Gemma-2B-it for UIIM, rule-based for ASP), is expected to remain low, on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds (e.g., $<200$ms on a standard GPU), ensuring that the adaptive safety layer does not introduce prohibitive delays in the user experience. These projected results, once empirically validated through the rigorous execution of our refined experimental plan, will unequivocally underscore the efficacy and practical advantages of our adaptive, intent-aware framework in establishing a superior performance-safety trade-off compared to existing static safety paradigms. Future work will include detailed ablation studies to quantify the direct contribution of UIIM accuracy to overall system safety metrics and to analyze the isolated effectiveness of each distinct ASP policy tier.
